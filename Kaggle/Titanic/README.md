**NOTE**

The classifier we make is only as good as the features that we select. If there are features which does not affect the survival and death then that feature can be considered trivial and can be ignored.In this case **avoid useless data** because it can affect  our algorithm's accuracy because by chance it might seem like useful where it is really not useful.

If we are just considering a single feature then at some points it might give an accurate result helping us to classify but there might be ranges where it might show an equal probability of survival and death. So it is important select multiple features. So it is a useful feature but not perfect.

Independent infromations are really useful. And is important to remove highly correlated data because classifiers may not understant that they are the same.
